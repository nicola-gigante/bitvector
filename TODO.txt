State of the union:
 - Size of the nodes now is completely general and choosen at runtime,
   and from initial testing seems to work.
 - Leaf size is fixed to 64 bits, needs to be generalized. This is not as 
   trivial as it sounds because a lot of code presumes that 
   bitview<>::value_type can be copied around like a little word, so we can't
   simply make leaf_t be a wrapper around, say, uint64_t[4] and live happy
   with performance (or maybe yes, who knows... we should measure)

Other todos:
 - Switch to std::deque as the underlying storage for nodes and leaves,
   in order to not being required to allocate all the worst-case nodes in
   advance every time.
 - Investigate other layouts for nodes in the buffer 
   (driven by measurements of cache misses)
 - More testing and performance profiling
