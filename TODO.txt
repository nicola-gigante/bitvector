Refactoring:
 - Take care of the different size of the leaves
 - Remove commented set_sum & co.

Speed and space:
 - Switch to std::deque as the underlying storage for nodes and leaves,
   in order to not being required to allocate all the worst-case nodes in
   advance every time.
   
Code quality:
 - Switch to the pimpl idiom for better readability of the interface 
   in the main header and to allow fast moves.
   
   
AND TESTING...
