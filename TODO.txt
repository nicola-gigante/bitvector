Requirements:
 - Generalize to nodes of arbitrary precision: finish the work on the
   arbitrary width 'word' type.
 - Consider the idea of integrating word and packed_view into a better,
   refactored packed_view

Speed and space:
 - Block based container to use as the underlying storage for nodes and leaves,
   in order to not being required to allocate all the worst-case nodes in
   advance every time.
   
Code quality:
 - Switch to the pimpl idiom for better readability of the interface 
   in the main header and to allow fast moves.
