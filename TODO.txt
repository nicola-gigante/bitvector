TODO:
 - Switch to std::deque as the underlying storage for nodes and leaves,
   in order to not being required to allocate all the worst-case nodes in
   advance every time.
 - Investigate other layouts for nodes in the buffer 
   (driven by measurements of cache misses)
 - A serious test suite
 - Performance profiling

In the future:
 - detect -fno-exception to switch asserts and exceptions 
   for error reporting in the API
 - Iterators (may require changes in the data structure to do it efficiently)
 - Word access and insertion
 - Word iterators
